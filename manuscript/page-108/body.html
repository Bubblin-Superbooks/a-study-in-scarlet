At eleven there was a fight at the &lsquo;White Hart&rsquo;; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o&rsquo;clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher&mdash;him who has the Holland Grove beat&mdash;and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin&rsquo;. Presently&mdash;maybe about two or a little after&mdash;I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin&rsquo; down, thinkin&rsquo; between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house.</p></div> </div>
