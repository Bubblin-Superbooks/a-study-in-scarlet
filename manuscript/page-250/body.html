The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.

Hence every man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart.</p><p>One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields, when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window, saw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway.
