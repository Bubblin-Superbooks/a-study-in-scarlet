<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Audley Court in there,&rdquo; he said, pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead-coloured brick. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find me here when you come back.&rdquo;</p><p>Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.</p></div> </div>
