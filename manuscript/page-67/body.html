SHERLOCK HOLMES,&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of &lsquo;Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.&rsquo; There had been no robbery, nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person.</p></div> </div>
