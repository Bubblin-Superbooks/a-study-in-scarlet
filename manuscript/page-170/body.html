<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once answered me in the affirmative.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,&rsquo; they said. &lsquo;He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where is he now?&rsquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will go up and see him at once,&rsquo; I said.</p><p>&ldquo;It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me the room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in spite of my twenty years&rsquo; experience.</p></div> </div>
