In this case however, in consideration of the note above of the original transcriber describing his care to try to duplicate the original 1887 edition as to typography and punctuation vagaries, no changes have been made in the ascii text file. However, in the Latin-1 file and this html file, present standards are followed and the several French and Spanish words have been given their proper accents.</p></div> </div>
