I get in the dumps at times, and don&rsquo;t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I&rsquo;ll soon be right. What have you to confess now? It&rsquo;s just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
