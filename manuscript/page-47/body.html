<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room. He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. &ldquo;I have to use this room as a place of business,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and these people are my clients.&rdquo; Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me.</p></div> </div>
