<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that fine fellow will trouble us again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will just go after him and see what he does with himself.&rdquo; With those words he took his hat and started off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber&rsquo;s mysterious death.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier&rsquo;s lips with many gasps and pauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should be no possibility of a mistake.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
