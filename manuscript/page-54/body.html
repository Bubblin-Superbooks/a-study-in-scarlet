I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories.&rdquo;</p><p>Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. &ldquo;No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Now, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his friends&rsquo; thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
