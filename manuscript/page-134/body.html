Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow her,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly; &ldquo;she must be an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.&rdquo; The hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair. Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind.</p></div> </div>
