Surely you will not withhold it any longer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Any delay in arresting the assassin,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity.&rdquo;</p><p>Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.</p><p>&ldquo;There will be no more murders,&rdquo; he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing us. &ldquo;You can put that consideration out of the question. You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do.</p></div> </div>
