<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you one other thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Patent leathers and Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible&mdash;arm-in-arm, in all probability. When they got inside they walked up and down the room&mdash;or rather, Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I could read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I&rsquo;ve told you all I know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to Halle&rsquo;s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
