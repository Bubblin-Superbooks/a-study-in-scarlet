Her daughter was in the room, too&mdash;an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn&rsquo;t escape my notice. I began to smell a rat.

Drebber, of Cleveland?&rsquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;The mother nodded. She didn&rsquo;t seem able to get out a word. The daughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter.</p></div> </div>
