<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.</p><p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t blame me if you don&rsquo;t get on with him,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t get on it will be easy to part company,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;It seems to me, Stamford,&rdquo; I added, looking hard at my companion, &ldquo;that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow&rsquo;s temper so formidable, or what is it? Don&rsquo;t be mealy-mouthed about it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
