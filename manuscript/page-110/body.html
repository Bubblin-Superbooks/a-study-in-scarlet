Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome, that I thought I&rsquo;d be none the worse for some one with me. I ain&rsquo;t afeared of anything on this side o&rsquo; the grave; but I thought that maybe it was him that died o&rsquo; the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o&rsquo; turn, and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher&rsquo;s lantern, but there wasn&rsquo;t no sign of him nor of anyone else.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
