What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was not I who killed her father,&rsquo; he cried.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But it was you who broke her innocent heart,&rsquo; I shrieked, thrusting the box before him. &lsquo;Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
