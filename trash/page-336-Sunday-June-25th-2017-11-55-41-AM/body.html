When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s time to get out,&rsquo; I said.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right, cabby,&rsquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little top-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of us.</p></div> </div>
